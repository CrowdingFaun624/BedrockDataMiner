    113 +       the copyright owner that is granting the License.
    114 + 
    115 +       "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
    116 +       other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common

    118 +       "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
    119 +       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
    120 +       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
    121 +       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
    122 +

    126 +       "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    127 +       including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    128 +       source, and configuration files.
    129 + 
    130 +       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    131 +       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but

    134 + 
    135 +       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    136 +       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    137 +       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    138 +       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
    139 + 
    140 +       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    141 +       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    142 +       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    143 +       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    144 +       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    145 +       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    146 +       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
    147 + 
    148 +       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    149 +       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
    150 +       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

    152 +       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
    153 +       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
    154 +       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    155 +       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    156 +       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    157 +       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
    158 +       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    159 +       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    160 +       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
    161 + 
    162 +       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    163 +       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    164 +       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
    165 + 
    166 +    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    167 +       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    168 +       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    169 +       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    170 +       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    171 +       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
    172 + 
    173 +    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    174 +       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    175 +       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    176 +       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    177 +       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    178 +       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    179 +       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    180 +       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    181 +       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    182 +       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    183 +       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    184 +       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    185 +       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    186 +       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    187 +       as of the date such litigation is filed.
    188 + 
    189 +    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    190 +       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    191 +       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    192 +       meet the following conditions:
    193 + 
    194 +       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
    195 +           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
    196 + 
    197 +       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    198 +           stating that You changed the files; and
    199 + 
    200 +       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
    201 +           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
    202 +           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
    203 +           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    204 +           the Derivative Works; and
    205 + 
    206 +       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
    207 +           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    208 +           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    209 +           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    210 +           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    211 +           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    212 +           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    213 +           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    214 +           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    215 +           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    216 +           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    217 +           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    218 +           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    219 +           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    220 +           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    221 +           as modifying the License.
    222 + 
    223 +       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    224 +       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    225 +       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    226 +       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    227 +       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    228 +       the conditions stated in this License.
    229 + 
    230 +    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    231 +       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    232 +       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    233 +       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    234 +       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    235 +       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    236 +       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
    237 + 
    238 +    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    239 +       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    240 +       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    241 +       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
    242 + 
    243 +    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    244 +       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    245 +       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    246 +       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    247 +       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    248 +       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    249 +       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    250 +       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    251 +       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
    252 + 
    253 +    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    254 +       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    255 +       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    256 +       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    257 +       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    258 +       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    259 +       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    260 +       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    261 +       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    262 +       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    263 +       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    264 + 
    265 +    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    266 +       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    267 +       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    268 +       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    269 +       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    270 +       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    271 +       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    272 +       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    273 +       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    274 +       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
    275 + 
    276 +    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
    277 + 
    278 +    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
    279 + 
    280 +       To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
    281 +       boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
    282 +       replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
    283 +       the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
    284 +       comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
    285 +       file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
    286 +       same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
    287 +       identification within third-party archives.
